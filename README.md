## Usage

Place your cursor within a file path in an editor, then hit `cmd+k, o` or use the command palette to open the file at that path.

Currently the path needs to be exactâ€”no fuzzy finding is used. If you're working in the project where the path resides, it can be relative to the root. If not, the path needs to be absolute.
